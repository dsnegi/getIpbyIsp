## Installation

Quickly describe how to install your project and how to get it running

1. Install Node dependencies

2. Install Bower dependencies

## Usage

Here you can write any kind of things that help others to use your project. Feel free to add as many aspects as you like. Here are just three examples:

### Build Process
If there is anyhting special about your build process or things that others have to take care of, write it down here

### Deployment
Since some projects follow a special kind of deployment, you should provide a proper description on how to deploy.

### Cronjobs
If you project is using cron jobs or any other automated scripts you should describe their functionality here.

## Support & Ownership

Feel free to ask [Roland LÃ¶sslein](info@weaintplastic.com) if you need some support when there are any questions left or if you need some support.
